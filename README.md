# hydrothermal-convection-in-porous-media
A model for hydrothermal convection in porous media. This has applications to several research problems, including the post impact hydrothermal evolution of the Chicxulub crater and the mining of elements from the silicate interior of asteroids and moons, in particular Jupiterâ€™s moon Europa. All the codes will be written in both MATLAB and Python.
