    # Description: The streamfunction of a numerical solution is computed at 
    #              the cell corners given the vector of numerical fluxes across 
    #              the cell faces.
    # Input: q = [qx;qy] Nf by 1 vector of all face fluxes. x-fluxes first.
    #        Grid = structure containing all information about the grid.
    # Output: PSI = Ny+1 by Nx+1 matrix containing the values of the
    #                     streamfunction along the cell corners.
    #         psi_min = minimum of PSI
    #         psi_max = maximum of PSI
    
    # Integrate horizontally along ymin boundary first then vertically into the domain.
    Qymin = np.vstack([0, np.cumsum(q[Grid.dof_f_ymin-1,:]*Grid.A[Grid.dof_f_ymin-1,:],axis=1)])  # Integral of flow into ymin boundary, this is a vector
    Qx = np.transpose((q[0:Grid.Nfx,:]*Grid.A[0:Grid.Nfx,:]).reshape(Grid.Nx+1,Grid.Ny))
    PSI = np.cumsum(np.vstack([-Qymin.T,Qx]),axis=0); # integrals into domain with Qymin as initial value
    psi_min = np.min(PSI);  psi_max = np.max(PSI)
