    # This function computes the operators and r.h.s vectors for both Dirichlet
    # and Neumann boundary conditions.

    # the vector dof_dir contains the columns that must be eliminated rather
    # then the columns that are retained in N. If you wanted to do it this way
    # you would have to create a new vector
    # dof_non_dir = setdiff(dof,dof_dir)
    # I suspect that the set-operators are expensive on large vectors, hence
    # we simply eliminate the rows.

    # Grid = structure containing all pertinent information about the grid.
